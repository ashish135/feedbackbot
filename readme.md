Project Name: Feedback Chat

DATABSE

dbname: feedback

I have used bootstrap cdn for styling. Also use custom css. You can register and login.

FOR DATA

I have used seeds for users, questions, and answers. You just need to run "php artisan db:seed command".

For DATABASE TABLES

I have used migrations for questions, answers, users, and feedback tables. You just need to run "php artisan migrate command".

For transition I have used css3 transition.
